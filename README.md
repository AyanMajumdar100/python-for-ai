# Python-for-AI

## Overview

**Python-for-AI** is a comprehensive repository designed to teach Python programming from basics to building AI models. It covers Python fundamentals, data handling, machine learning, and deep learning concepts. This project is ideal for beginners as well as intermediate learners looking to implement AI models in Python.

The repository is structured to provide hands-on examples and projects to help learners gradually move from Python basics to advanced AI applications.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries & Frameworks**:
  - **NumPy**: For numerical computations
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
  - **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization
  - **Scikit-learn**: For traditional machine learning models
  - **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: For deep learning models
  - **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and experimentation

## Project Structure

The repository is divided into the following main components:

### Basics
- **Python Basics**: Variables, data types, loops, conditionals, functions, and OOP.
- **Data Handling**: Working with lists, dictionaries, CSV files, JSON, and NumPy arrays.
- **Visualization**: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn for basic plots and charts.

### Machine Learning
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables.
- **Supervised Learning**: Regression, classification, and model evaluation.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques.

### Deep Learning / AI Models
- **Neural Networks**: Building simple feedforward networks.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: For image recognition tasks.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: For sequence data and time series prediction.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Loss functions, optimizers, and performance metrics.
